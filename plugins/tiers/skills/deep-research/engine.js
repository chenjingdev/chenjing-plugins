// tiers-deep-research: Scope → pipeline(Search → URL-dedup → Fetch+Extract) → 3-vote Verify → Synthesize
// Variant of the bundled deep-research with pinned per-agent model/effort so the fan-out
// never silently inherits the session model. Three tiers:
//   workers (search/fetch)          → model/effort args, default opus/high
//   judge   (verify voters, ~75×)   → judge arg, default = worker model
//   brain   (scope + synthesize, 2×) → brain arg, default = worker model
// Any tier arg accepts a model name or "inherit" (= session model). brain:'fable' or
// brain:'inherit' on a fable session upgrades the two single-call bookends for ~zero cost.
// Invoke: Workflow({scriptPath: '<plugin-root>/skills/deep-research/engine.js', args: '<question>'})
//     or: same scriptPath, args: {question, model, effort, judge, brain}

// ─── Tier resolution from args ───

// object (which would silently turn the whole JSON into the question and drop all tiers).
// If the string parses to an object, unwrap it.
